[Quickstart tips] Experiment procedures:

Control: Hire test subjects, train and equip them with weapons and armour to establish a human baseline in combat.
Phase 1: Eliminate a village and use the findings to research basic mutagenics. Use gained corpses to produce mutagens, and augment your test subjects.
Phase 2: Continue research and create more refined mutagens, which enable more powerful mutants.
[Unimplemented] Phase 3: Produce advanced mutagen serums which can upgrade existing 'morphs' into superior forms.
[Unimplemented] Phase 4: World domination, and the Mutagenesis Engine."
